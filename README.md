# Good Weather

A lightweight weather app which shows a 5-day forecast for a selected location.

Hosting URL: [https://good-weather-d60d7.web.app](https://good-weather-d60d7.web.app)

The app is designed to be used in the everyday, something you would open right before heading out the door, and one which would provide context on whether you should be prepared for adverse weather effects like heavy rain.

As such, the focus is on relaying weather information quickly, in laymen terms, and arranged to promote important information first.
